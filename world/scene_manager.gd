## Global scene/level manager (autoload "SceneManager").
##
## Two kinds of transition:
##   • change_level()  — swaps the level *inside the persistent shell* (game.tscn).
##                       The player, camera and inventory UI are kept alive, so
##                       this is a seamless swap with no reload. Use it between
##                       shell levels (Level 2, 3, ...).
##   • enter_shell() / exit_to() — full scene changes, used to move between the
##                       legacy standalone world (Level 1 / game_world.tscn) and
##                       the shell. Inventory still carries over because it lives
##                       in the shared player_inv.tres resource.
##
## Spawn placement: every level exposes one or more Marker2D nodes in the
## "player_spawn" group. Pass the marker name to drop the player there.

## frame between the two.
